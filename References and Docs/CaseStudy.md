## Introduction

The idea for this app came one fateful evening when my girlfriend and I could not do to figure out what to do for a date night. I thought why not make an app about it! Now some months later here we are.


## Development

This app was actually one of my first expirementations with react. So as I was learning I was adding features. The central problem of this app was to get inputted data and store and retrieve it in and from state and local storage. I had to draw a diagram to show how the information flowed so I could understand exactly how I should code it and it took a few rewrites to get it to a point where data flowed correctly. 

## Outcome

 I believe flexibility of an application is important to a user experience and I've achieved that here. The app retrieves data from a pre-determined list as well as being able to use user inputted items that it stores in local storage. This is a starting point for further customization options down the line that ensures that users can have options that are reflective of their preferences and needs.
